# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and selected **Coding Problems** that I solve while learning DSA.  
The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in core DSA concepts.
